# Workflows

VAMPIRES is a very dynamic instrument used in a variety of observing scenarios. The workflows below represent some of the most common use-cases of VAMPIRES, and while open-use observer modes are prioritized there are also tutorials for engineering related tasks.

## Open-use observing

1. Speckle imaging (TODO)
2. Polarimetric differential imaging (TODO)

## Engineering

3. Pixel scale and PA offset measurement (TODO)
4. Satellite spot calibration (TODO)
